CSS Precedence (Specificity):
#id     → highest priority  
.class  → second highest  
tag     → lower priority  
*       → universal selector (lowest)

Content-box → Width/height apply only to content; padding and border increase total size.
Border-box → Width/height include content, padding, and border; total size stays fixed.

Property: background-size
Value(s): cover | contain | auto | specific width & height
Description: Controls how a background image is scaled to fit its container.
    - cover: The image will scale to completely cover the container. It may crop parts of the image to maintain aspect ratio.
    - contain: The image will scale to fit inside the container without cropping, but may leave empty space.
    - auto: The image displays at its original size.
    - width height: You can set specific sizes (e.g., 100px 50px).

Example:
    body {
        background-image: url("image.jpg");
        background-size: cover;      /* Covers the entire area */
        background-position: center; /* Centers the image */
        background-repeat: no-repeat;/* Prevents tiling */
    }
