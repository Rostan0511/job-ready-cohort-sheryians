    <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
    <p>Today was one of those calm, peaceful days where you just enjoy the little things. I went for a walk in the park and noticed how refreshing it felt to be surrounded by nature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The air was crisp, the sunlight was warm, and I could hear the soft rustling of leaves in the breeze. Sometimes, it’s these quiet moments that make you feel most alive.</p>

    <p>While walking, I spotted this beautiful bird sitting quietly on a branch. It almost felt like it was posing for the picture.</p>

    <h3>Things I saw in the park (List Example):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Families enjoying picnics on the grass</li>
        <li>Children playing on the swings</li>
        <li>A couple walking their golden retriever</li>
        <li>People reading books under shady trees</li>
    </ul>
